## Background

### Application Domain

Sanding of wooden panels for the furniture industry.

### Use Case Needs / Agility Challenge Description

Use Case Needs: Panels in different shapes and sizes need to be processed from the top and from the sides as part of preparation 
of the surface for different types of finish. An example of custom shape wood panel is provided in the following image.

Processing is done manually due to lack of flexible solutions which can easily adapt to frequently changing production in a user friendly way.

The challenges for the company originate mainly from two sources: the increased demand and unpredictability of their production. 
Different workers require different processing times depending on their skill and experience, and inconsistencies in production 
quality mean that sometimes a workpiece may even be returned for corrective re-processing to ensure that the quality of the
finished product is not compromised.

### Main Objectives

The proposed solution aims to achieve high flexibility for automating the processing of flat workpieces.
In order to achieve this goal, the system has been designed to manage different parameters of the sanding process,
which are not tied to a particular model or brand.
Workers will be able to choose the correct combination of parameters for a certain type of material in relation to the 
desired finish and, based on that, the system will automatically configure itself.
